        Position it with minus some negative number of pixels from corresponding sides.

    <p>To display the X close button we used a div with <span style="color:darkgoldenrod">class="close-button"</span>
    but it's styling should only apply if it is inside content-box. For example the X below should look like a plain X:
    </p>
    <!-- Your style should not affect this X below-->
    <div class="close-button">X</div>
    <!-- This text below should bold and it SHOULD DISPLAY!-->
    <div class="special-text">This is a special text and it SHOULD display</div>
